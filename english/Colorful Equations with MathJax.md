# Colorful Equations with MathJax

Stuart Riffle wrote up a great explanation of the Fourier transform. There are a number of great visualizations in his post, but the climax is his explanation of the inverse discrete Fourier transform formula:

What a brilliant representation! My first thought was that more equations should have such elegant explanations that focus on the comprehension of the reader. Iâ€™d love to be able to produce such clear explanations in this style:

$$\textcolor{Purple}{X}_\textcolor{Green}{k}
=\textcolor{Magenta}{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}}
\textcolor{Blue}{x_n}
\textcolor{Red}{e}^
{\textcolor{Red}{i}\textcolor{Orange}{2\pi} 
\textcolor{Green}{k}
\textcolor{Magenta}{\frac{n}{N}}
}.$$

**To find   ,    , and .**

**Remark:**

1.  Html color setting

1.  The raw equation is $$X_k=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_ne^{i2\pi k \frac{n}{N}}.$$
